## v2.2.3 — bug fix 1 — 2026-10-31

- Recognize older timestamp-based completion logs, saved summaries and terminal checklists before offering a device handoff. Migrate local terminal records that older clients never queued.
- Renew active owner sessions with a heartbeat; expire abandoned handoff sessions after their inactivity/flight-duration grace without creating completed trip logs.
- Add an account-scoped “This flight has already ended” action to close a stale run on every device, with compare-and-swap protection for newer runs.
- Use new black-on-white favicon, Apple, install and branding asset filenames, plus a versioned manifest, to bypass old icon cache entries.
- Expose the deployed release and Vercel commit at `/api/version`; preserve the v2.2.3 package version.

## v2.2.3 — 2026-10-31

- Use a locally bundled OFL Doto dot-matrix font for flight boards, trips and flight history.
- Mark missed departures delayed and auto-cancel after three hours; send check-in, doors, overdue/disembark and cancellation reminders while the app is open. Opening preflight no longer counts as takeoff.
- Expand radar-only sampling with active OurAirports airfields and heliports, without adding them to commercial airport lists.
- Add the user-provided Brasileirinho profile: one F33A Bonanza, PS-BZR, 24 historical itinerary legs through 30 October, registration-only live tracking and optional Cessna simulation substitutions.
- Retain observed route flight numbers and aircraft types on the device for 180 days independently of live-position expiry.
- Show estimated arrivals, last-position context and transatlantic route labels; keep estimates anchored to observations and source timetables.

## v2.2.2 — 2026-10-31

- Separate home discovery from route paths and replace country fill with subtle white boundaries.
- Rotate radar sampling across every source airport coordinate, including airports absent from the visible catalog. Keep provider requests bounded and preserve route endpoint assignment.
- Show the MyRoster emblem in black on white in the app, install icons and sharing metadata, with refreshed icon URLs.
- Persist terminal flight updates across navigation/offline periods, reject stale completion prompts, repair older active records using log/trip evidence, and stop timers when the remote run ends or disappears.

## v2.2.1 — 2026-10-31

- Discover countries and clickable airport markers while exploring the globe on the home page.
- Inspect airport and airline descriptions, country directories, operating airlines and hubs before opening their pages.
- Keep discovery layers, data fetching and selection panels disabled on route and flight pages.
- Bundle low-resolution Natural Earth country boundaries locally; airport and airline descriptions use the existing sanitized reference catalog.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-10-31

- Use the supplied MyRoster logo as a monochrome transparent PNG in the app and a black mark on a white background for PWA, Apple and favicon icons.
- Keep the same globe rotation speed in airport browsing and the home view. Enable drag and zoom during flights, with a mobile-friendly exploration mode, zoom buttons and a recenter control.
- Back controls return to the previous internal page. Deep links have a safe fallback, and search queries stay in the history entry so Back restores the results.
- Offer commercial flight numbers observed on the exact airline and direction, including recent device history. Keep the selected or manually entered number through planning and flight. Do not infer a commercial number from an alphanumeric operational callsign or invent a number for a static catalog route.

Flight-number availability still depends on observed provider data; the historical route catalog does not contain schedules or flight numbers. User-entered numbers belong to simulation plans.
